The letter 's' stands for source. I wanted clip to copy the contents inside a text-based file. So I thought of making a command by my own.

So something like,
cat source.c | clip

becomes

clips source.c

- For Windows
@echo off
cat %1 | clip

- For Linux (Do "sudo apt install xclip" first")
#!/bin/bash
cat $1 | xclip -i -selection clipboard
