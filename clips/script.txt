The letter 's' stands for source. I wanted clip to copy the contents inside a text-based file. So I thought of making a command by my own.

So something like,
cat source.c | clip

becomes

clips source.c

- For Windows
  1. It is recommended to have a directory dedicated to custom commands and append the path to the environment variables (obviously)
  2. Create a .bat file called clips in the path 
@echo off
cat %1 | clip

- For Linux 
  1. "sudo apt install xclip" first
  2. make a new script called clips (without .sh extension) in /usr/bin and then chmod +x clips. At least that's what I did)
#!/bin/bash
cat $1 | xclip -i -selection clipboard
