For Windows, you need AutoHotKey working
Create an .ahk script
Copy paste the following to the .ahk file

Script:
Capslock::Esc
; RAlt::Space (Another example swapping right alt and space)

For Linux, I go to the path /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/pc and swap Escape to Caps_Lock from there.

Code:
Change
key <ESC>  {	[ Escape			]	};
To
key <ESC>  {	[ Caps_Lock			]	};

key <CAPS> {	[ Caps_Lock	]	};
To
key <CAPS> {	[ Escape	]	};

Or append this line to ~/.profile
setxkbmap -option caps:swapescape
